<h1>About this Site</h1>
<p> This Web site contains some interesting and maybe useful articles about web development, Internet issues, computers, and other related and unrelated topics that catch my interest. I update it irregularly. It was originally created to brag about my talents and skills, and as a platform for me to learn about web development while pursuing a certificate at New York University. Exploring the Solar System utilizes PHP and a MySql database to provide and organize information about planets, moons, and space exploration.  It also have a quiz created with JavaScript. It is currently incomplete but I tend to work on it and add more data from time to time. The rest of the site utilize a lot of JavaScript (both jQuery and vanilla JS). </p>
